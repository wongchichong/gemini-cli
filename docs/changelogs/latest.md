## Highlights

- **Dynamic Sandbox Expansion:** Implemented dynamic sandbox expansion and
  worktree support for both Linux and Windows, enhancing development flexibility
  in restricted environments.
- **Tool-Based Topic Grouping (Chapters):** Introduced "Chapters" to logically
  group agent interactions based on tool usage and intent, providing a clearer
  narrative flow in long sessions.
- **Enhanced Browser Agent:** Added persistent session management, dynamic
  read-only tool discovery, and sandbox-aware initialization for the browser
  agent.
- **Security & Permission Hardening:** Implemented secret visibility lockdown
  for environment files and integrated integrity controls for Windows
  sandboxing.
